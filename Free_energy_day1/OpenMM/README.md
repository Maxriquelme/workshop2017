# OpenMM information/introduction and density calculation

This provides a very brief introduction to OpenMM, and a sample density calculation with OpenMM.
The key material is [`Session2.ipynb`][Session2.ipynb].

## Manifest

### Things you may want to use
- [`Session2.ipynb`](Session2.ipynb): Jupyter notebook with Session 2's contents/examples.
- [`density.py`](density.py): Script for estimated the density of a mixture (with input files already prepared); gives an example of how one could do production-level calculations with OpenMM that iterate until converged. Referenced in `Session2.ipynb`

### Supporting materials
- [`images`](images): Images used by files here, especially Jupyter notebooks.
- [`sample_files`](sample_files): Other files, such as molecule inputs, used by Jupyter notebooks here.
- [`density_simulation`](density_simulation): Sample output from the production stage of a density simulation from `density.py`; includes only the `.csv` data, not the trajectory file.

### Generated by the notebook
- [`mixtures`](mixtures): Mixture systems set up by SolvationToolkit.
