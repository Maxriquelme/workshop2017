# Free Energy Calculations Tutorial

This provides tutorial/example material relating to performing free energy calculations with OpenMM and Yank, as well as some introductory materials/examples relating to OpenMM.
This content was prepared for the Symposium on Molecular Interactions in Chemistry and Biology 2017, of December, 2017, and in particular Day 1 of the Workshop, focusing on free energy calculations.

## Basic outline of the day

### Morning lecture/theory session:
- Force fields
- Break
- Free energy calculations

### Afternoon hands-on/tutorial session:
- Basic hydration free energy calculations with Yank/OpenMM
- Break
- Analysis and a view of what's going on under the hood/using OpenMM
- Break
- A binding example: Host-guest docking and free energy setup with visualization
- We also provide further example materials/illustrations if you would like to continue along several alternate tracks

## Manifest
- [`prerequisites.md`](prerequisites.md): The software you need for these tutorials should already be available on the computers you will use for this workshop. However, this document lists what you would need to install and how if you would like to use these tools on your own resources later.

## Acknowledgments
Various pieces of code/examples here are drawn from other individuals and other sources; credit is typically given where this is done (e.g. in the code itself).
In addition, we particularly thank:
- Maximilano R. Troncoso for help with software prerequisites/installation and testing
- Léa El Khoury for host-guest examples
